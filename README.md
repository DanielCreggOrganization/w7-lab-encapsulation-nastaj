## Lab Setup
Create a package called `ie.atu.encapsulation`. Create a `Main` class inside this package. Place all the below classes from the DIY sections into this package. 

## 1. Basic Data Hiding

### Learning Objective
Learn how to hide data using private access modifiers and understand why it's important for building robust applications.

### Explanation
Data hiding is the fundamental concept of encapsulation where we restrict direct access to certain components of an object, typically by making fields private. This protection prevents unauthorized access to internal data and helps maintain the object's state consistency. By controlling access to our object's data, we can ensure that the object's state is always valid and can't be corrupted by external code.

### Example
```java
public class Counter {
    private int count; // Private field - cannot be accessed directly from outside
    
    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    
    public void displayCount() {
        System.out.println("Current count: " + count);
    }
}
```

### Visual Representation
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External Code] -->|Cannot Access| B[private count]
    A -->|Can Access| C[public methods]
    C -->|Can Access| B
```

### DIY Exercise: Secret Message
Create a `SecretMessage` class that:  
- Has a private String field to store a message. 
- Has a public method to display the message
- Create a `Secret Message` object in the `Main` class
- Try and call the message field directly using the dot operator
- Print the message to the console using the public method

## 2. Getters and Setters

### Learning Objective
Learn how to provide controlled access to private fields using getter and setter methods.

### Explanation
While private fields prevent direct access, we often need controlled ways to read and modify their values through getter and setter methods. Getter methods allow read access to private fields while maintaining encapsulation, and setter methods provide a way to modify private fields with proper validation. This approach gives us the flexibility to change how we store and validate data without affecting code that uses our class.

### Example
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    
    // Getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    // Setter method
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

### Visual Representation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    External Code->>+Person: setName("John")
    Person->>-Person: name = "John"
    External Code->>+Person: getName()
    Person-->>-External Code: "John"
```

### DIY Exercise: Temperature Converter
Create a `Temperature` class that:
- Stores temperature in Celsius (private)
- Provides getter methods for both Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Provides a setter method that accepts Celsius values

## 3. Data Validation

### Learning Objective
Learn how to validate data in setter methods to maintain data integrity and implement reusable validation using helper methods.

### Explanation
Data validation is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of our objects' state. By validating input before allowing changes to our private fields, we can prevent invalid states and ensure our objects behave correctly. Proper validation in setters helps catch errors early and provides clear feedback about what went wrong. To avoid duplicating validation logic between constructors and setters, we can extract common validation rules into private helper methods.

### Example 1: Basic Validation
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Deposit amount must be positive");
        }
        balance += amount;
    }
    
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
        }
        if (amount > balance) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient funds");
        }
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Using Validation Helpers
```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor uses validation helpers
    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = validateName(name);
        this.age = validateAge(age);
    }

    // Setters use the same validation helpers
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = validateName(name);
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = validateAge(age);
    }

    // Private validation helper methods
    private String validateName(String name) {
        if (name == null || name.trim().isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be empty");
        }
        return name;
    }

    private int validateAge(int age) {
        if (age < 0 || age > 150) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid age");
        }
        return age;
    }
}
```

### Visual Representation
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Data] -->|Validate| B{Valid?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Update Field]
    B -->|No| D[Throw Exception]
    
    E[Constructor/Setter] -->|Uses| F[Validation Helper]
    F -->|Valid| G[Update Field]
    F -->|Invalid| H[Throw Exception]
```

### DIY Exercise: Grade Book
Create a `Grade` class that:
1. Has these private fields:
   - studentName (String)
   - numericGrade (int)
   - courseCode (String)

2. Implements these validation helper methods:
   - validateStudentName(String name)
   - validateGrade(int grade)
   - validateCourseCode(String code)

3. Uses the helpers in both:
   - Constructor
   - Setter methods

4. Implements these features:
   - Validates that grades are within range (0-100)
   - Validates that student name is not empty
   - Validates that course code matches pattern (e.g., "CS101")
   - Provides a method to get the letter grade (A: 90-100, B: 80-89, etc.)
   - Throws appropriate exceptions with meaningful messages for invalid input

Example structure:
```java
public class Grade {
    private String studentName;
    private int numericGrade;
    private String courseCode;

    // TODO: Add constructor

    // TODO: Add getters and setters

    // TODO: Add validation helper methods

    // TODO: Add method to calculate letter grade
}
```

## 4. Constructors and Initialization

### Learning Objective
Learn how to properly initialize encapsulated objects using constructors.

### Explanation
Constructors ensure that objects are created in a valid state by properly initializing all necessary fields. A well-designed constructor validates its parameters and establishes class invariants, preventing the creation of invalid objects. The constructor represents the first line of defense in maintaining encapsulation, as it controls how objects are created and initialized.

### Example
```java
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    
    // Constructor with validation
    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        if (make == null || make.trim().isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Make cannot be empty");
        }
        if (model == null || model.trim().isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Model cannot be empty");
        }
        if (year < 1886) { // First automobile was invented in 1886
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid year");
        }
        
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
    
    // Getters
    public String getMake() { return make; }
    public String getModel() { return model; }
    public int getYear() { return year; }
}
```

### Visual Representation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>+Car: new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2024)
    Car->>Car: Validate make
    Car->>Car: Validate model
    Car->>Car: Validate year
    Car->>Car: Initialize fields
    Car-->>-Client: New Car object
```

### DIY Exercise: Book Catalog
Create a `Book` class that:
- Has private fields for ISBN, title, and author
- Has a constructor that validates all fields
- Provides only getter methods (immutable object)
- Throws exceptions for invalid input

## 5. Business Logic Methods

### Learning Objective
Learn how to implement methods that operate on encapsulated data while maintaining object consistency.

### Explanation
Business logic methods perform operations using the object's private data while maintaining encapsulation and data integrity. These methods encapsulate not just data but also the behavior and rules that apply to that data. By keeping business logic within the class, we ensure that all operations on the data follow the same rules and maintain consistency.

### Example
```java
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;
    private int yearsOfService;
    
    // Constructor
    public Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.yearsOfService = 0;
    }
    
    // Business logic methods
    public void giveRaise(double percentage) {
        if (percentage <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Percentage must be positive");
        }
        salary += salary * (percentage / 100);
    }
    
    public void completeServiceYear() {
        yearsOfService++;
        if (yearsOfService % 5 == 0) {
            giveRaise(5); // 5% raise every 5 years
        }
    }
    
    public double calculateBonus() {
        return salary * (yearsOfService / 10.0);
    }
    
    // Getters
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public double getSalary() { return salary; }
    public int getYearsOfService() { return yearsOfService; }
}
```

### Visual Representation
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Employee {
        -String name
        -double salary
        -int yearsOfService
        +giveRaise(percentage)
        +completeServiceYear()
        +calculateBonus()
    }
```
